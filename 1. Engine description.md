# Engine description #
### Architecture ###
**Event Engine** is a system deisgned for efficient processing of streams of events, either on-line or off-line. On-line processing is aggregation of events and scoring based on analytical model, using information from streams, while off-line processing means aggregation of events used to build models automatically. The engine is fully scalable and customizable, therefore it can be used in various branches of business, like:

- Gaming
- Recommending
- Web analytics
- Internet of Things (processing streams of events from devices' sensors)

### Functionalities ###

- Providing efficient service of streams of events coming from multiple sources at the same time
- Saving retail events to repositories, their off-line aggregation and creating analytical tables based on these events, which are used to create models
- Storage of off-line users' states
- Aggregation - a module used to count aggregates, both in off-line and on-line mode (used for model building and scoring respectively), connected to processing path in chosen environment
- Automatic creation of analytic models through Automatic Business Modeler
- Automatic deployment of new models through metadata
- On-line scoring - checking of conditions starting particular model scoring, score evaluation and returning the score to the client
