# Aggregates module #
Aggregates are calculated both in on-line and off-line mode, in both modes the same computational code is used.
#### On-line mode ####
In on-line mode, the computing is parallel for every user id. For active users, on-line aggregates are calculated and held in memory. After fixed time of user's inactivity, defined in configuration file, aggregates are saved in a database.
#### Off-line mode ####
In off-line mode, the computing is also parallel for every user id. Aggregates are calculated basing on retail events saved in a repository. Off-line aggregating can be scheduled.
#### Types of aggregates ####

- Counted incremently for all data
- Counted in time window with specific number of events
- Counted in sliding time windows with specific number of events
- Target windows - used to count target (only off-line mode)

One event may belong to multiple windows. A list of calculated aggregates is defined in metadata.

#### List of aggregates ####

- Number of occurences
- Sum
- Last value
- Flag
- Minimum value
- Maximum value
- Derived aggregates defined in Java (for example: aggregate1 + aggregate2)
- Aggregates resulting from defined dictionaries (see [Dictionaries](http://event-engine-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6.%20Components%20of%20metadata/#dictionaries) section)
