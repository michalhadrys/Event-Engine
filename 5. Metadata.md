# Metadata #
Metadata are created and stored in GDBase - a relational database, part of Algolytics analytical platform.

Tables with metadata are created with following SQL code:
```sql
CREATE TABLE clients(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY /*, ...*/)
CREATE TABLE external_data(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, client_id INTEGER /*, ...*/)
CREATE TABLE variables(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, client_id INTEGER NOT NULL, event_id INTEGER NOT NULL, definition TEXT NOT NULL, type INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(type = 1 OR type = 2), default_value TEXT)
CREATE INDEX ON variables(client_id)

### Tables structure ###

- clients
	- id - id, a primary key
	- authorization data
	- other data about a client
- external data
	- id - id, a primary key
	- client_id
	- data pointing at external source of data
- variables
	- id - id, a primary key
	- event_id - corresponds with the evendId field in JSON
	- definition - a definition of transforming event to a variable (JSONPath/JSONiq/...)
	- type (numerical, categorical) - type of the variable defined in DBConstants (VARIABLE_...)
	- default_value - default value of the variable, used if the definition returns null value
- aggregates
	- id - id, a primary key
	- variable_id - indicates a variables table. If the aggregate is not created from a variables table, the value is null
	- aggregate_type - type of the aggregate defined in DBConstants (AGGREGATE\_...) (see part X)
	- window_type - type of the window defined in DBConstants (WINDOW\_...) (see part X). Each variable used by target must have window type set to WINDOW\_TARGET
	- window_size (count/time) - window size, defined as number of occurrences or time in miliseconds
	- window_shift (count/time) - window shift (for windows with shift), defined as number of occurrences or time in miliseconds
	- definition - a Java expression defining aggregate as a derivative of other aggregates. Every aggregate used in the definition must be listed in derived_aggregates table. If the aggregate is not a derivative aggregate, the value is null
	- return_type - type of aggregate defined by definition column (DBConstants.VARIABLE\_...)
	- dictionary_id - a dictionary from dictionary table. If null then the aggregate do not use a dictionary
	- external\_data\_id - id of external data from external data table
	- external\_data\_name - name of variable in external data
	- name - variable name, used in Java expressions, unique for client_id
- derived_aggregates
	- derived\_aggregate\_id - id of derived aggregate from aggregates table
	- aggregate_id - ids of aggregates used in creating the derived aggregate (may be multiple ids for given derived\_aggregate\_id)
- triggers (definition of scoring moment, i.e. definition of a moment of creating a training line with target)
	- id - id, a primary key
	- definition - definition of given trigger variable, which is an expression in Java using input variables to calculate value of trigger variable. The expression returns true or false, it may be also a definition of user's affiliance to a model. Input variables from the Java expression must be listed in the trigger_aggregates table.
	- needs_change - scoring occurs only, if during the last launch of trigger the definition returned false
	- group - a group to which the trigger belongs. If the model defines triggers from different groups, and each group contain multiple triggers, scoring occurs only, if at least 1 trigger in every group returns, that scoring must occur
- models
	- id - id, a primary key
	- used - if false, the model is not scored
	- target\_aggregate\_id - indicates target
	- target_start - time in miliseconds. The target window starts after this time
	- target_length - length of the target window in miliseconds. If the value is 0, the length is to the end of data
	- target_length_exact - if 1, shorter target windows will be omitted
	- saved\_state\_time - to what time the state of users was calculated. Value is set by application
- model_aggregates (defining models' arguments, every model can use various aggregates, and every aggregate can be used in various models)
	- model_id - id of the model from models table
	- aggregate_id - id of the variable from aggregates table (may by many for given model\_id)
	- used - if positive, the variable is passed to scoring code, if negative, the variable is used in model building
- trigger_aggregates (defining triggers' arguments, every trigger can use various aggregates, and every aggregate can be used in various triggers)
	- trigger_id - id of the trigger from trigger table
	- aggregate_id - id of the variable from aggregates table (may by many for given trigger\_id)
- model_triggers (defining models' triggers, every model can use various triggers, and every trigger can be used in various models)
	- model_id - id of the model from models table
	- trigger_id - id of the trigger from triggers table (may by many for given model\_id)
- dictionary (a dictionary mapping values from JSON to variables)
	- id - id of group or interval of values
	- categorical - if true, then value variable from this table is used as an input. If false, then start, start\_inclusive, end, end\_inclusive are used as an input
	- value - a specific value from JSON
	- start - start of an interval
	- start_inclusive - defines, whether the start of the interval is open or closed
	- end - end of an interval
	- end_inclusive - defines, whether the end of the interval is open or closed
	- mapped_value - value passed to an aggregate

### Window types ###

```java
public final static int WINDOW_TARGET       = 0;
public final static int WINDOW_GLOBAL       = 1;
public final static int WINDOW_TIME         = 2;
public final static int WINDOW_TIME_SLIDE   = 3;
public final static int WINDOW_COUNT        = 4;
public final static int WINDOW_COUNT_SLIDE  = 5;
```

### Aggregate types ###

```java
public final static int AGGREGATE_COUNT     = 1;
public final static int AGGREGATE_SUM       = 2;
public final static int AGGREGATE_LASTVALUE = 3;
public final static int AGGREGATE_EXISTS    = 4;
public final static int AGGREGATE_MIN       = 5;
public final static int AGGREGATE_MAX       = 6;
```
