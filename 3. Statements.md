# Statements #
### Information about statements ###
#### Statements sending ####
Client's application sends statements (events) to the engine in JSON format through HTTP connection (REST API). HTTP connection sends statements in packages. Data encryption is done using the SSL protocol.
#### Multiple sources ####
Data can come from multiple sources (users, game servers). Statements are distinguished with a *client_id* variable. The application is customizable for specific customers through defining dedicated metadata (variables, aggregates, models).
#### Statements processing order ####
Statements processing order may not be maintained. It is determined on the basis of event time saved in JSON.
### Formats of JSONs containing events ###
#### Generic formats ####
For generic formats of JSONs, the Event Engine provides the most efficient processing.

###### Example of JSON: ######
```json
{"arrival_ts":1232344,  
 "client_id":1, 
 "user_id":5, 
 "event_id":23,
"eventType1":
[
{"eventA":{"value":10, "name":"AAA"},
 "value":"value1"
},
{"eventB":{"value":45, "name":"BBB"},
 "value":"value2" 		
}
			   ]
			}
```
###### Examples of variable expressions ######
```
$.['eventType1'].[0].['eventA'].['value']
``` 
returns 10

```
$.['eventType1'].[1].['value']
``` 
returns "value1"

###### Examples of queries containing additional conditions ######
In generic format of JSONs, queries containing additional conditions are also optimized. These conditions can check equality by "==" sign and can be connected by "&&" sign.

```
$.['eventType1'].[0].['eventA'].[?(@.['value'] == 10 && @.['name'] == "AAA")].value
```
 returns [10]

```
$.['eventType1'].[0].[?(@.['eventA'].['value'] == 10 && @.['eventA'].['name'] == "AAA")].value
```
 returns "value1"

```
$.[?(@.name == 'eventType1')].['type'].[0].[?(@.event == 'eventA')].['value']
```
 returns [10]

#### Other formats, compatible with JSONPath ####
These formats provides worse processing efficiency. An analytic must add rules defining the change from JSON format to a metadata variable (see chapter 9).

###### Example of JSON ######
```json
{"arrival_ts":1232344,  
 "client_id":1, 
 "user_id":5, 
 "event_id":23,
 "name":"eventType1",
 "type":
 	[
{"event":"eventA",
 	 	    "value":10
},
{"event":"eventB",
 	 	    "value":45
}
 	]
}
```

###### Example of variable expression ######
```
$.[?(@.name =~ /.*eve.*/i)].['type'].[1].['value']
```
returns [45]

### Responses ###
A statement with score is a direct response to the statement with an event.
The statement consists of the following fields:

- userId - id of the user
- scores - a list of models and scores; empty, if none of the models were scored
- modelId - id of the model
- score - score value for each model

```json
{"userId":5, 
 "scores":
[ 
{"modelId":1, "score":0.16596808075912742},
{"modelId":2, "score":0.56665555575912789},
{"modelId":3, "score":0.78954308075912573}
    	]
}
```
