# Off-line processing and modeling #
Process of off-line aggreagetes computing and modeling should be repeated at fixed intervals (induced automatically or manually). For every model an analytical table is created. The table contains 1 line for each user, that fulfils trigger condition and has counted target. For every analytical table, the Automatic Business Modeler builds a model. Deployed models and information about used variables (model's signature) are saved to metadata. The method inducing off-line processing starts an API ABM method, that enable to build a model in only 1 query (for more information see [ABM documentation](http://e-abm.com/api_documentation.html#resources-models-create-models-in-one-request)). A table with aggregates is an input table to ABM process, that selects suitable variables and calculates optimal model automatically. This method also enables saving the aggregates table for further analysis or manual modeling. For this purpose, a GDBase alias and a table name must be given.
